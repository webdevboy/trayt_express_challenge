# Trayt express.js coding challenge

To start the express server, run:

`npm install`

and then

`npm start`

# Coding Challenge

Please read through this document before you start

## Requirements

A simple express.js app already exist to save you some time. You should fork this repo and build on top of it.

You should allocate about 2 hours to work on this project. Although it is okay to exceed that time.

### Build a route to recommend movies for users based on user's rated movies

`GET localhost:9000/recommendations`
Expected json response example
```jsonld=
{
    "recommendation": {
        "favDirector": "Christopher Nolan",
        "favGenre": "Adventure",
        "byDirector": [
            {
                "id": "tt6723592",
                "name": "Tenet",
                "director": "Christopher Nolan",
                "genres": [ "Action", "Sci-Fi" ]
            },
            {
                "id": "tt5013056",
                "name": "Dunkirk",
                "director": "Christopher Nolan",
                "genres": [ 'Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller', 'War' ]
            },
            // ...
        ],
        "byGenre": [
            {
                "id": "tt1345836",
                "name": "The Dark Knight Rises",
                "director": "Christopher Nolan",
                "genres": [ "Action", "Adventure" ]
            },
            {
                "id": "tt1375666",
                "name": "Inception",
                "director": "Christopher Nolan",
                "genres": [ "Action", "Adventure", "Sci-Fi", "Thriller" ]
            },
            // ...
        ]
    }
}
```

1. The route should have a middleware where it use user's `Bearer Token` to get the user's `userId`
(which you will hard coded to `9aaec1fc-ea13-4783-81f8-a998c1e0d648`)
2. First you should get a list of movies a user has rated, `ratedMovies`. Using `getRatedMovies(userId)`
3. Figure out what is the name of a user's favorite director, `favDirector`. By counting the most popular director in `ratedMovies` list that have `userRating` larger or equal to 7 (1~10 scale)
4. Figure out what is a user's favorite genre, `favGenre`. By counting the most popular genre in `ratedMovies` list that have `userRating` larger or equal to 7 (1~10 scale)
5. Use `favDirector` to get a list of recommended movies made by this director (`byDirector`)
6. Use `favGenre` to get a list of recommended movies in the genre (`byGenre`)
7. Filter out movies in `byDirector` and `byGenre` that's already in the user's `ratedMovies`. (Because that means the user already watched it)
8. Use `getSavedRecommendations(userId)` to see if the user already have saved recommendation available. If it is the case, return saved recommendation. It not, get recommendation using the steps above and use `saveRecommendations(userId, recommendation)` to save the user's recommendation.

### Helper functions

5 helper functions are available to mock the function of a database.

#### Get user's movie rating
A helper function `getRatedMovies(userId)` in `helperFunctions.js` is available to get a list of movies that user already rated. `userRating` have a scale of 1 to 10
```
// example output
[
  {
    id: 'tt0816692',
    name: 'Interstellar',
    director: 'Christopher Nolan',
    genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller' ],
    userRating: 9
  },
  {
    id: 'tt0414993',
    name: 'The Fountain',
    director: 'Darren Aronofsky',
    genres: [ 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi' ],
    userRating: 5
  },
  ...
]
```

#### Get Recommendation by director
A helper function `getRecommendationByDirector(director)` in `helperFunctions.js` is available to get a list of recommendated movies made by the same director
```
// getRecommendationByDirector('Christopher Nolan')
// example output
[
  {
    id: 'tt6723592',
    name: 'Tenet',
    director: 'Christopher Nolan',
    genres: [ 'Action', 'Sci-Fi' ]
  },
  {
    id: 'tt5013056',
    name: 'Dunkirk',
    director: 'Christopher Nolan',
    genres: [ 'Action', 'Drama', 'History', 'Thriller', 'War' ]
  },
  ...
]
```

#### Get Recommendation by genre
A helper function `getRecommendationByGenre(genre)` in `helperFunctions.js` is available to get a list of recommendation movies that's in the same genre
```
// getRecommendationByGenre('Adventure')
// example output
[
  {
    id: 'tt5104604',
    name: 'Isle of Dogs',
    director: 'Wes Anderson',
    genres: [ 'Animation', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Sci-Fi']
  },
  {
    id: 'tt2278388',
    name: 'The Grand Budapest Hotel',
    director: 'Wes Anderson',
    genres: [ 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Crime' ]
  },
  ...
]
```

#### Save/get Recommendations
A helper function `saveRecommendations(userId, recommendation)` should be used to save the user's `recommendation` the first time user uses that route. (use's saved `recommendation` will be wiped after 10 seconds in this test. Realistically it should be something like a day or more)

A helper function `getSavedRecommendations(userId)` should be used to get user's `recommendation` if it is already saved.
